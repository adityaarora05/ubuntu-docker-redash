Redash is a visualization tool that separates the logic layer from the view layer. It enables one to create Dashboards, combining data from Multiple Data Sources, provides different Views (Eg: Bar charts, Pie charts, Box Plots etc). 

Redash has an enterprise version, and a community edition. The community edition has installation support given for :-
1. AWS 
2. Google Cloud
3. Ubuntu OS

Now, if you have a local machine which does not have Ubuntu, Docker is one of the ways for installing Redash.

Following, is the link to my blog, where I have provided details instructions for the same. Have a look, and feel free to let me know in case issues arise.
